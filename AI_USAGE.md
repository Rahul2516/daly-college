# AI Usage Declaration

I used AI tools (ChatGPT) to assist with the development of this project. Below is a breakdown of how AI was utilized:

## 1. Code Generation & Boilerplate
- Generated the initial Tailwind CSS grid structures for the `CampusInfra` and `AboutGrid` sections to speed up the layout process.
- Used AI to generate the dummy data (JSON arrays) for the `LatestNews` and `Moments` sections.

## 2. Animation Assistance
- Consulted AI for the optimal `GSAP` syntax to handle the staggered entrance animations in the `Announcements` widget.

## 3. Accessibility & Optimization
- Used AI to scan my components for accessibility violations (e.g., missing `aria-labels`, contrast issues) and applied the suggested fixes.
- Generated the code-splitting logic (`React.lazy`) to improve the Lighthouse performance score.

**Note:** All AI-generated code was manually reviewed, tested, and integrated into the final project structure by me.
